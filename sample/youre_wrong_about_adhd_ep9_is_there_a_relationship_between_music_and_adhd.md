[00:00.000 --> 00:16.240]  Hello, I'm Katie Breathwick. And I'm Sam Pittis. And welcome to our new podcast. You're
[00:16.240 --> 00:22.800]  wrong about ADHD. No, you are. No, you are. No, you are. This is stupid. Stop it. Sam
[00:22.800 --> 00:27.240]  and I have been friends for nearly 20 years and a couple of years ago, we both found out
[00:27.240 --> 00:32.740]  we have ADHD. But I think it's fair to say we feel fairly differently about it. Getting
[00:32.740 --> 00:39.000]  an ADHD diagnosis answered lots of questions, but it also raised new ones. Each week, we're
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.920]  going to be talking about everything from our experiences being diagnosed as adults
[00:43.920 --> 00:49.800]  to relationships, coping strategies and how we manage these very special brains. So we
[00:49.800 --> 00:53.440]  can learn more about ADHD and what it means to be neurodivergent.
[00:53.440 --> 01:01.060]  Hi, Sam. Hi, how are you? Yeah, I'm all right. Actually, I've had a lovely sunny walk into
[01:01.060 --> 01:05.880]  global this morning. We've had an email from a listener about something that's really
[01:05.880 --> 01:12.480]  important to you and me. And it reads, as a musician, I'm so curious about music and ADHD.
[01:12.480 --> 01:16.720]  A lot of the research talks about deficits with music making and those with an ADHD
[01:16.720 --> 01:22.120]  brain. But some of the greatest musicians and music lovers I know are ADHD. So I'd
[01:22.120 --> 01:28.280]  love to hear you two chat about music and ADHD. Keep the episodes coming. Pip from Melbourne.
[01:28.280 --> 01:33.520]  It's such a great question, because it's a brave statement, but I honestly believe music
[01:33.520 --> 01:40.160]  is central to who I am. My mum says I sang before I could talk. She was trying to figure
[01:40.160 --> 01:48.680]  out why I was singing this thing. I'll be your long-haired lover from Liverpool. And
[01:48.680 --> 01:54.480]  I have been obsessed with music ever since, listening to it, playing it, dancing to it.
[01:54.480 --> 01:58.960]  It really affects my mood and it can boost me. It can bring me down. And sometimes I
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.680]  use that as a tool. Sometimes it's something that I can't control. So today, we're going
[02:04.680 --> 02:12.160]  to talk about music. It's so key to who I am. How about you? Is it as important to
[02:12.160 --> 02:15.960]  you as it is to me? I think it is, but I think I've got quite a complex relationship with
[02:15.960 --> 02:20.520]  music. So for me, when I talk about being hyper, when I talk about being energetic with
[02:20.520 --> 02:25.440]  my ADHD, often it comes out musically. It will come out with bursts of singing. It will
[02:25.440 --> 02:28.600]  be that I'm suddenly walking around the house, singing at the children to the point where
[02:28.600 --> 02:32.960]  they're going, Dad, that's too much. I once actually got a detention in geography for singing
[02:32.960 --> 02:35.960]  Royal Britannia. I think I just stood up and sung it. I mean, fair enough, I'm not sure
[02:35.960 --> 02:39.320]  the teacher was very impressed. And I also remember us ending up in a bar at about two
[02:39.320 --> 02:42.720]  o'clock in the morning. It was a bar that used to do West End musicals. You put a fiver
[02:42.720 --> 02:46.280]  in the glass on the grand piano and they'd play the piece for you and you'd sing it.
[02:46.280 --> 02:51.120]  I love singing. Always love singing. It is giving voice to that feeling inside of you,
[02:51.120 --> 02:55.880]  which for ADHD is exactly what you want to do. But I think what I've realised is that
[02:55.880 --> 03:00.280]  music for me, whether it's singing or listening to music, is very much mood dependent. So
[03:00.400 --> 03:05.280]  when I'm high, when I'm up, when I'm flying, I want Beethoven, I want Wagner, I want Jimi
[03:05.280 --> 03:09.640]  Hendrix, I want Black Sabbath, I want something that meets me where I am and just almost sort
[03:09.640 --> 03:14.200]  of wipes my head and just makes me fly. But if I'm trying to concentrate, if I'm trying
[03:14.200 --> 03:19.880]  to work, if I'm trying to have a conversation, I cannot have background music at all. So
[03:19.880 --> 03:23.760]  if I go to a dinner party, for example, or if I go to somebody's house and I walk in
[03:23.760 --> 03:27.240]  and they've got sort of low mood music in the background, I just, the evening's written
[03:27.240 --> 03:28.240]  off.
[03:28.240 --> 03:29.800]  You could do something as simple as ask them to turn it off, obviously.
[03:29.840 --> 03:32.800]  And sometimes if I know them well, I do. But if you don't, it's a bit difficult to kill
[03:32.800 --> 03:35.840]  the mood of the parties for everyone. So then you're suddenly trying to concentrate really
[03:35.840 --> 03:39.240]  hard on what somebody's saying, knowing that, you know, it's a bit of Tina Turner singing
[03:39.240 --> 03:43.240]  in the background or something like that. There's a reference for the kids. And I do
[03:43.240 --> 03:46.640]  find it's one of those situations. Yes, of course, you could ask them to turn it off.
[03:46.640 --> 03:51.160]  But that's one of those ADHD moments where, honestly, you mask and you go, I have to put
[03:51.160 --> 03:55.120]  up with this because everybody else is enjoying themselves. But I cannot for the life of me
[03:55.120 --> 03:59.560]  actually hear what's going on. And it's almost painful. It's like a physical pain. It's like
[03:59.640 --> 04:05.000]  somebody is blaring the music directly into your ear while you're trying to concentrate
[04:05.000 --> 04:05.800]  on something else.
[04:05.800 --> 04:09.840]  And you talk about the different ways in which you respond to those very different kinds
[04:09.840 --> 04:15.760]  of music. Is that something you can use as a tool if you are either not feeling it, maybe
[04:15.760 --> 04:20.120]  you need a bit of a juge or you need something to maybe calm you down? Can it work for you
[04:20.120 --> 04:20.640]  in that way?
[04:20.640 --> 04:25.480]  I find it sometimes will expend energy. So if I'm really, really hyper, it'll wear me
[04:25.480 --> 04:28.840]  out because usually if I'm listening to music like that, it'll be, for example, if I'm doing
[04:28.880 --> 04:33.120]  a DIY project, it is, it's blasting, you know, recording the ring cycle while I'm walking
[04:33.120 --> 04:34.280]  around the house doing jobs.
[04:34.280 --> 04:35.520]  That's terrifying.
[04:35.520 --> 04:39.280]  Yeah, it is. But by the end of it, I remember there was a job I did, I listened to Wagner
[04:39.280 --> 04:43.120]  about two days solid and, you know, but it's again, it's like everything with ADHD is once
[04:43.120 --> 04:48.640]  you're getting high, it's making sure you're not blasting that for too long and making sure
[04:48.640 --> 04:52.040]  that you come down afterwards. So I think that's why I say I have a complex relationship
[04:52.040 --> 04:56.200]  with it because I absolutely love music and I can really feel it and really enjoy it. But
[04:56.240 --> 04:59.440]  I know that quite often for me, it's mood dependent. What about you?
[04:59.520 --> 05:04.960]  So I'm, is it my emotional dysregulation? I don't know. But I am somebody who loves to
[05:04.960 --> 05:10.040]  have a good sob at a sad story. Maybe it's my Irish genes. But actually, you know, that's
[05:10.040 --> 05:10.920]  a really good example.
[05:10.920 --> 05:15.880]  Irish folk music, I can listen to it, I can play it, I can sing it for hours and hours
[05:15.880 --> 05:20.440]  and hours because there's a narrative in lots of those songs that comes with an emotional
[05:20.440 --> 05:23.840]  punch. You know, you look at something like the Fields of Athen Rai, someone disappearing
[05:23.880 --> 05:27.760]  off to Australia whilst their love is left behind outside the prison walls. These are
[05:27.760 --> 05:34.640]  sad songs. And I have, I have spent nights crying the same song night after night after
[05:34.640 --> 05:40.080]  night. I know what's coming. I know what's coming. But I still feel that real kind of
[05:40.080 --> 05:43.840]  smushy feeling whenever the song kind of comes to an end.
[05:43.880 --> 05:47.200]  And that's music at its best. That's music touching you emotionally.
[05:47.200 --> 05:47.600]  Yeah.
[05:47.600 --> 05:52.120]  But how do you find it interacts with your ADHD? So do you find that there are sort of
[05:52.160 --> 05:54.640]  moods or times when the music's too much for you?
[05:55.120 --> 06:00.440]  Oh, gosh, that's a really good question. Very rarely, I do have to turn it off. But what
[06:00.440 --> 06:06.160]  I have tended to find is that there is a kind of music that I can put on in the background
[06:06.280 --> 06:11.440]  and continue to work. And it calms me down. So I was a chorister as a teenager. It gave
[06:11.440 --> 06:18.880]  me enormous pleasure. And choral music, especially, I find incredibly calming, again, quite
[06:18.880 --> 06:23.680]  emotional, depending on the piece, but definitely something that helps me concentrate. And I
[06:23.680 --> 06:30.360]  have, I have a little album on my computer called Choral Music for Spesh. And I play
[06:30.400 --> 06:35.600]  every single night, every single night, this album comes out and I'll put it on. And it's
[06:35.600 --> 06:42.120]  just, you know, it's howls, it's whittaker, it's all these beautiful kind of incredibly
[06:42.160 --> 06:47.600]  crushy chords that do something extraordinary in my brain. They definitely kind of make the
[06:47.600 --> 06:51.440]  spaces in my brain expand. And I have that sort of response to Jacob Collier. I don't
[06:51.440 --> 06:57.160]  know if you've come across young Jacob Collier, this incredible new that he's the new Mozart,
[06:57.200 --> 07:03.880]  isn't he? So extraordinary. He is finding new directions in harmony. And fireworks go
[07:03.880 --> 07:07.960]  off in my brain when I listen to his music. And it's just extraordinary. I mean, one
[07:07.960 --> 07:13.640]  thing I find very interesting about my response to music, especially, is that when I was younger,
[07:13.640 --> 07:19.880]  when I was a, you know, teenager, and through my early twenties, I never ever needed to drink
[07:19.880 --> 07:23.600]  as much or take any of the drugs that my friends needed to take in order to have a good time
[07:23.600 --> 07:28.800]  at a party. Because if there was really great music on at that party, I would be having a
[07:28.800 --> 07:32.920]  great time anyway. And they'd be taking whatever so they could stay up until four o'clock in
[07:32.920 --> 07:37.280]  the morning and stay pumped up. I'd be on that dance floor. Anyway, I'd have been on that
[07:37.280 --> 07:41.560]  dance floor from 11 o'clock at night. I'll be there until six a.m. going, you know, like
[07:41.600 --> 07:45.080]  the clappers. But it's interesting you say that because what you've described is music
[07:45.080 --> 07:49.840]  for you essentially being a tool for emotional regulation. And, and that, you know, it's
[07:49.840 --> 07:51.280]  the old cliche music is a drug.
[08:02.200 --> 08:05.960]  You know, it's it is extraordinary, isn't it that that sort of that fizz and that buzz
[08:05.960 --> 08:10.760]  that ADHD gives you, you mix that with music, and it is the most
[08:11.080 --> 08:17.760]  your party party for one. Thank you very much. And I'll be lucky. I'll be lucky that we get to
[08:17.760 --> 08:22.440]  do that. And I've done it. I've been alone at the house and thought, yeah, you know, I need a bit
[08:22.440 --> 08:27.920]  of motivation. I've got to do some flipping house work. I don't want to do it. So I put on
[08:27.920 --> 08:32.880]  something fabulous, some Thompson twins or whatever. And off I go. And, you know, my husband
[08:32.880 --> 08:38.520]  always says has to be mid tempo so I can walk to it whilst I'm dancing. And, and, and off I go.
[08:38.520 --> 08:43.800]  And it's, it's free. And how great is that? Yeah. And what about what about music making?
[08:43.920 --> 08:50.160]  Because we often talk about this idea of ADHD and creativity. I have always wanted to play
[08:50.160 --> 08:54.760]  the piano. But when I sit down at the piano, I mean, my head just goes off in 100 different
[08:54.760 --> 09:00.320]  directions. I cannot for the life of me concentrate. And when I managed to play, I think I did
[09:00.320 --> 09:05.080]  Mary had a little lamb with one hand. As soon as you've been shoes, second hand, my brain and
[09:05.080 --> 09:09.320]  body just can't keep up with each other. I've never been able to master that and play an
[09:09.320 --> 09:13.720]  instrument. That's really interesting. Did you have you had lessons? Did you? No, I never had
[09:13.720 --> 09:18.080]  lessons. And I think this is the classic thing about me. It's a bit like when we talked to Tony
[09:18.080 --> 09:22.800]  Lloyd about whether I can ride a bike. Yeah, I was just thinking that it's the, and I totally
[09:22.800 --> 09:27.320]  recognise this in myself as something about ADHD that I've had to work on. It is the being
[09:27.320 --> 09:30.760]  faced with something where you look at it and the excitement is there. I should be able to do
[09:30.760 --> 09:34.440]  this. I want to be able to do this. I understand how this works. But hang on. It takes patience.
[09:34.440 --> 09:40.040]  It takes practice. It takes routine. It takes regulation. I'm out. And that's the, and that's
[09:40.040 --> 09:44.400]  the block before you've even started. And the thing about singing is it just comes naturally
[09:44.400 --> 09:48.480]  to me. And that's that's the whole, the really difficult thing about ADHD is that when you
[09:48.480 --> 09:53.160]  really want to do something and you can't, and the thing, you know, we use the word can't, you
[09:53.160 --> 09:58.040]  can do it, but it's going to take hard work. And probably if you've got ADHD, what's hard work for
[09:58.040 --> 10:00.040]  everybody else is probably even more hard work for you.
[10:00.480 --> 10:04.200]  But it's so interesting, isn't it? Because you say you didn't have lessons. And I wonder if you've
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.800]  been caught early enough, Sam, and whether, you know, so I was singing before I could talk. And my
[10:09.800 --> 10:14.880]  mum was advised by the nursery teacher to get me music lessons, because the nursery teacher
[10:14.880 --> 10:19.520]  claimed I had perfect pitch. I don't, but she claimed I did. So I started lessons with Mrs.
[10:19.520 --> 10:24.120]  Rudd, my piano teacher at the age of four and my with my legs swinging on the piano, they didn't
[10:24.120 --> 10:29.280]  reach the floor. And, you know, starting off with one finger, I kind of jumped over those
[10:29.280 --> 10:34.360]  feelings that you describe of feeling frustrated and not being able to do it. By the time I was
[10:34.360 --> 10:40.360]  able to knock out a tune, I've already reached that stage where every time you're able to do that,
[10:40.400 --> 10:48.320]  you get a dopamine hit. Yeah. And for me, I found that bizarrely with scales. Now you tell me
[10:48.680 --> 10:53.640]  whether that's normal, because I bet it's not. But I used to love practicing my scales, because
[10:53.640 --> 10:58.680]  every time I did one perfectly, I got a dopamine hit. And of course, if you can practice scales,
[10:58.720 --> 11:05.240]  everything else falls into place. And, you know, so from it's learning the piano has been a
[11:05.240 --> 11:12.640]  privilege and, and a properly wild ride for me. I wouldn't say that I have a particular talent,
[11:12.840 --> 11:17.280]  especially when it comes to sort of, you know, improv and things like that. But I do love to
[11:17.320 --> 11:21.680]  play. And there's one aspect to me learning instruments, which I do think is very ADHD
[11:21.800 --> 11:27.520]  identified by my husband. I love to take up an obscure instrument for two to three weeks, and
[11:27.520 --> 11:28.200]  then never play again.
[11:28.200 --> 11:31.800]  That would be me. That would be me all over. I've got a piano, by the way. I just never play it,
[11:31.800 --> 11:32.280]  but go on.
[11:32.600 --> 11:38.280]  Piano recording, ukulele, Irish flute. I've got various percussion instruments. I've got, you
[11:38.280 --> 11:44.160]  know, and these things, you know, the collection grows. And the ukulele I printed out about 300
[11:44.160 --> 11:44.840]  pieces of music.
[11:44.840 --> 11:45.320]  Amazing.
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.440]  Yeah. And sat there on the bedroom floor. Why the bedroom floor? The bedroom floor for two to
[11:50.440 --> 11:54.480]  three weeks, you're playing the ukulele thinking, Oh, yeah, this will be fun. I'll take some
[11:54.480 --> 11:56.920]  hold in and we can play this, you know, on the beach.
[11:56.960 --> 11:59.520]  Well, your family would have been probably pleased you left that behind.
[12:00.400 --> 12:05.280]  No, well, the piano accordion that I learned to play Abba on, that got hidden in the attic
[12:05.280 --> 12:11.120]  by my husband. I was so dreadful at it. But, you know, it is, and that's definitely ADHD,
[12:11.240 --> 12:16.160]  isn't it? You know, so you're, so you have tried, if you have a piano in your house, there's
[12:16.160 --> 12:18.760]  clearly a desire there for you to learn.
[12:18.840 --> 12:23.600]  Yeah, there is. There's definitely a desire to learn. But the issue for me is getting past
[12:23.640 --> 12:27.360]  exactly what you've just described of. I really want to do this. It's there. Oh, this is really
[12:27.360 --> 12:32.880]  exciting. Hang on a minute. Two hands. What? Oh, no, I can't be bothered with this. And it's
[12:32.880 --> 12:37.160]  that. And it's the same, but it's the same hill that we all climb up with ADHD. It's just a
[12:37.160 --> 12:41.040]  question of whether you want to keep going to the top. And hopefully one day I will. I think
[12:41.040 --> 12:43.680]  it's just a question of life gets in the way, doesn't it?
[12:43.720 --> 12:50.480]  Well, I wonder, I wonder if I wonder if actually what you should do is embrace the knowledge
[12:50.480 --> 12:54.680]  that your instrument is your voice. And, you know, maybe you should focus on that. Maybe
[12:54.680 --> 12:58.560]  you should have lessons singing lessons. I've lost my top notes. Oh, stop it. You know, you'll
[12:58.560 --> 13:02.960]  regain them if you sing and you yeah, absolutely. Your voice always improves if you're singing
[13:02.960 --> 13:07.680]  regularly and practicing some muscle. So if you were to meet up with somebody who could
[13:07.720 --> 13:11.440]  give you some pointers on what to do and you sang scales and did all those things, you
[13:11.440 --> 13:16.520]  can you have such a lovely voice. This is genuinely maybe something that would give you
[13:16.520 --> 13:20.840]  pleasure. And, you know, it does it's all those things, isn't it? It slows down the brainwaves
[13:20.840 --> 13:26.040]  and enables you to come classic ADHD, though. I like I like singing, but I like singing when
[13:26.040 --> 13:30.480]  people least expect it. I much prefer singing in geography and in the street and in my daughter's
[13:30.480 --> 13:45.440]  face and in the newsroom rather than in a choir. We'll see. Going back to this idea
[13:45.440 --> 13:49.840]  of creativity and ADHD, I think there is a sort of desire out there and always has been
[13:49.840 --> 13:54.600]  to link neurodivergence with genius. And I think also when we look at sort of what we
[13:54.600 --> 13:58.920]  would consider geniuses of the past, there's always this desire to dive into their emotions
[13:58.960 --> 14:02.160]  and even their sort of mental health. You've only got to think about Schumann, Beethoven,
[14:02.160 --> 14:07.680]  Rachmaninov. There is a decent case out there for Mahler, perhaps having ADHD. And we actually
[14:07.680 --> 14:10.640]  wrote about it. There's an article we wrote for the Classic FM website. But I think the
[14:10.640 --> 14:15.080]  difference with him is, OK, he may have had ADHD, he may not have, but he was also incredibly
[14:15.080 --> 14:20.080]  gifted. There's also some interesting stories about Mozart and people love to sort of look
[14:20.080 --> 14:25.920]  at him and say, well, is he neurodivergent? Did he have ADHD? Was he dyslexic? Was he bipolar?
[14:25.920 --> 14:30.120]  There is a story of a lady who was sat at the piano and she was playing some of his music
[14:30.120 --> 14:33.160]  and he came and sat along next to her and he played with her. And then he appeared to get
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.000]  bored about halfway through and then started jumping around and meowing like a cat and
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.240]  knocking over chairs, which is a story that's obviously lived long in the annals of history.
[14:41.240 --> 14:42.240]  Sounds like you.
[14:42.240 --> 14:43.240]  Yeah, well, it does.
[14:43.240 --> 14:44.240]  It does sound like you.
[14:44.240 --> 14:45.240]  It does.
[14:45.240 --> 14:46.240]  It does.
[14:46.240 --> 14:49.600]  It's literally you that you're describing there. Oh, my God. I know that people really
[14:49.600 --> 14:55.160]  kick back, don't they? Kick back on this idea that you would retrofit an ADHD diagnosis
[14:55.400 --> 15:01.600]  to historical figures. I love it. I love the retrofitting because I think it validates
[15:01.600 --> 15:05.920]  my belief that neurodiversity is a wonderful thing and the gifts that it's given the world.
[15:05.920 --> 15:12.560]  And Mozart's a really good example. He was definitely autistic. His ability to remember
[15:12.560 --> 15:18.200]  music like that. He was impulsive. He was rude. He was really annoying. You and I both
[15:18.200 --> 15:25.080]  know as ADHDers, we really annoy people. We're really irritating to some people and
[15:25.080 --> 15:27.720]  a lot of people found him really, really irritating.
[15:27.720 --> 15:31.400]  Well, what about the story about the misery? Because I don't buy that at all. Yes. Yes.
[15:31.400 --> 15:32.880]  But you do, don't you?
[15:32.880 --> 15:39.120]  This story about the Allegri Misery kept under lock and key by the Vatican because they realised
[15:39.120 --> 15:44.320]  the power of this piece of music and they only brought it out to be performed once at Easter
[15:44.320 --> 15:50.720]  and he goes along to St Peter's in Rome. Here's it once. Walks away, writes the whole
[15:50.720 --> 15:53.600]  thing down. It's 14, 15 minutes of music and...
[15:54.000 --> 15:54.600]  It didn't happen.
[15:54.600 --> 15:55.600]  It didn't happen.
[15:55.600 --> 15:56.600]  Oh, come on.
[15:56.600 --> 15:57.600]  It's just one of those stories.
[15:57.600 --> 16:04.520]  But also, Mozart benefits from what I believe to be, going back to a conversation we've
[16:04.520 --> 16:12.040]  had earlier, a perfect, ideal version of an ADHD education. His father discovers, realises
[16:12.040 --> 16:17.080]  that his son has this exceptional gift, which I think is down to his neurodiversity, and
[16:17.080 --> 16:21.600]  takes him on the road, takes him on the road. He's not forced into a classroom to learn
[16:21.600 --> 16:26.920]  Latin and Greek. These will be useless things for Mozart. He is on the road performing,
[16:26.920 --> 16:33.680]  getting dopamine hits at every new keyboard that he meets. And yes, those challenges
[16:33.680 --> 16:40.640]  of his autism slash ADHD come out later in his life when he writes things the night before.
[16:40.640 --> 16:46.160]  We know he wrote overtures at midnight on the day of the first performance. He would
[16:46.160 --> 16:51.320]  turn up and perform piano concertos himself, having not written the music and he'd improvise
[16:51.520 --> 16:57.440]  them. He was an extraordinary brain, incredibly gifted, obviously, but he was different.
[16:57.440 --> 17:02.920]  He was different, but I do struggle with retrofitting diagnosis onto people. And I think, particularly
[17:02.920 --> 17:07.240]  with him, because I think it creates a caricature and there is a caricature of him being a bit
[17:07.240 --> 17:12.240]  scatty and a bit crazy. But actually, here is this incredibly gifted, talented composer
[17:12.240 --> 17:16.840]  and musician who also was able to tour around the world, who was able to hold his own concerts
[17:16.880 --> 17:21.440]  and was actually really organised at times as well. And I just think sometimes the danger
[17:21.440 --> 17:27.080]  is that we create caricatures of people that fit our nice little box. And I think as we've
[17:27.080 --> 17:31.680]  described so many times, ADHD neurodivergence doesn't fit into a neat little box. And I
[17:31.680 --> 17:36.920]  do think when you start to link genius with neurodivergence, you're trying to sort of
[17:36.920 --> 17:40.840]  create expectations that not all of us can manage. You know, my piano playing suggests
[17:40.840 --> 17:44.200]  I'm perhaps not a Mozart. There was more going on than just his ADHD.
[17:45.080 --> 17:49.080]  And I'm not for one moment suggesting that everybody with ADHD is a genius or everybody
[17:49.080 --> 17:55.960]  with autism is a genius. We know that. But I also think that it's as if neurodivergence
[17:55.960 --> 18:03.440]  expands the brain in a different way and allows us to explore places we've never been before.
[18:03.440 --> 18:09.720]  And that's exactly what Mozart did. There are, you know, that sense that do musicians
[18:09.720 --> 18:17.640]  who also happen to have ADHD come with an ability to invent new music. Jacob Collier,
[18:17.640 --> 18:24.680]  I think is is an example. And that sense that somebody is not afraid to look in corners
[18:24.680 --> 18:26.120]  that other people haven't looked in before.
[18:26.120 --> 18:30.600]  Well, we've got just the person to answer some questions about where ADHD intersects
[18:30.600 --> 18:36.320]  with music and creativity for musicians. Tristan Hunt, who's an ADHD coach who specialises
[18:36.320 --> 18:37.160]  in the music industry.
[18:39.960 --> 18:53.640]  Hi, Tristan. Nice to have you. So music is really important to us. Sam and I are presenters at
[18:53.640 --> 18:59.960]  Classic FM and obviously have both spent our lives surrounded by music, performing and listening
[18:59.960 --> 19:06.120]  to music. Do you think that there is a relationship between music and ADHD?
[19:06.200 --> 19:11.720]  Absolutely. On a number of different levels, it can be hugely beneficial and helpful for
[19:11.720 --> 19:13.080]  people that have ADHD.
[19:13.080 --> 19:16.200]  What do you think, though, about creativity? Because there's a lot, I think there's a lot
[19:16.200 --> 19:22.120]  made sometimes about the idea that ADHD is a superpower. ADHD comes with creativity. And
[19:22.120 --> 19:26.120]  yet at the same time, those of us with ADHD will find that sometimes that's a block to
[19:26.120 --> 19:30.760]  doing things like learning instruments or practicing. Do you think that there is a particular
[19:30.760 --> 19:33.880]  sort of creative arc that comes with people with ADHD? What's your experience?
[19:34.360 --> 19:39.160]  For sure. So I think that's an awful lot of the people that come into the music industry
[19:39.160 --> 19:45.720]  especially are neurodiverse. I ran a survey some years back looking at the proportion of
[19:45.720 --> 19:49.080]  people with neurodiverse conditions within the music industry. And it shows that a very
[19:49.080 --> 19:53.400]  high number of those people have such conditions because they have what's known as non-sequential
[19:53.400 --> 19:57.800]  thinking. So they don't think in a regular sequential way. They think in a non-sequential
[19:57.800 --> 20:00.840]  way, which means that they're great at putting together lots of disparate ideas that come
[20:00.840 --> 20:04.680]  together as new creative ideas. So I think that's one of the reasons that we find an awful
[20:04.680 --> 20:10.120]  lot of those people working in the space. On that subject, that non-sequential thinking that you
[20:10.120 --> 20:16.360]  describe, is that cause or effect? Do we learn to think in a creative way because of our ADHD
[20:16.360 --> 20:21.720]  and we're living in a neurotypical world? Or do we arrive? Are we born with this sort of special
[20:21.720 --> 20:27.880]  way of thinking? So ADHD is what's known as a neurobiological condition and that the neuroscience
[20:27.960 --> 20:32.040]  that's out there is weighted very much towards the idea that there's a heavy genetic component
[20:32.040 --> 20:37.080]  to the condition. So that people are essentially born with ADHD. There's a school of thought as
[20:37.080 --> 20:43.080]  well that says that the ADHD can be expressed by certain environmental conditions, but essentially
[20:43.080 --> 20:47.400]  ADHD is something that we're born with. So people are predisposed to having this high degree of
[20:47.400 --> 20:51.240]  creativity. And of course, if you've got this sort of predisposition towards this higher level of
[20:51.240 --> 20:54.920]  creativity and an enjoyment and love of music, you're going to be drawn towards the music industry.
[20:54.920 --> 20:58.760]  And I think that's one of the reasons that we find so many people with ADHD working in the music
[20:58.760 --> 21:02.600]  industry. That's fascinating. I suppose one of the things that I suppose I question because we've
[21:02.600 --> 21:06.200]  talked about this, we've talked about different composers and different musicians over the years
[21:06.200 --> 21:11.240]  that sometimes I think there is an idea out there, a bit of a stereotype that if you're neurodiverse
[21:11.240 --> 21:16.280]  somehow that's linked to genius, but surely you can be attracted to a creative industry. You can
[21:16.280 --> 21:20.760]  have a way of thinking that is very creative, but there's got to be another part to that. You know,
[21:20.760 --> 21:26.440]  some people who I have ADHD are also gifted in certain ways. You know, yes, you can be attracted
[21:26.440 --> 21:31.000]  to the industry. Yes, you can perhaps have a creative bent, but there still needs to be sort
[21:31.000 --> 21:35.640]  of hard work and talent there as well, I suppose. Absolutely. It's not enough, of course, just to
[21:35.640 --> 21:41.800]  have ADHD. You have to have the tenacity to work in what is a very competitive, busy industry.
[21:41.800 --> 21:45.480]  There's an awful lot of people, of course, who want to work in the music industry. And you've got to
[21:45.480 --> 21:52.760]  have the discipline to create a framework. We talk a lot about in the coaching space around
[21:52.760 --> 21:57.960]  building structures and routines and able to function effectively within your chosen career,
[21:57.960 --> 22:04.200]  in this case within the music industry, because it's a very busy, often noisy environment with
[22:04.200 --> 22:10.040]  a lot of pressures to commute, to travel, to interact, to turn up on time, to turn up on
[22:10.120 --> 22:14.600]  time. Absolutely, Katie. So things that are neurotypical in air quotes and people might
[22:14.600 --> 22:18.840]  find easier, such as turning up on time, being consistent, those sorts of things,
[22:18.840 --> 22:24.280]  these are often big challenges for people with ADHD. So one of the things we sometimes see is
[22:24.280 --> 22:30.120]  that you have people with a huge amount of talent and ability, not being able to actualize, so not
[22:30.120 --> 22:35.080]  being able to self actualize and live out that talent and ability, because they are constrained
[22:35.080 --> 22:39.400]  by simple things like turning up on time. And of course, if you don't turn up on a regular basis,
[22:39.400 --> 22:46.280]  you'll get fired. So these sorts of constraints do impose an extra level of work, if you like,
[22:46.280 --> 22:50.040]  for people with ADHD. So they have often a huge amount of talent. Some people consider
[22:50.040 --> 22:53.240]  these talents to be superpowers and they absolutely can be. But there's still a huge
[22:53.240 --> 22:56.760]  amount of work to sort of keep the show on the road, if you like, to enable people to show up
[22:56.760 --> 23:02.840]  and perform as they might like to. And how successful is coaching in teaching neurodiverse
[23:02.840 --> 23:07.720]  people to learn these skills? Because they're quite tricky ones to learn later in life, aren't they?
[23:07.720 --> 23:13.320]  They are. So just sort of personal disclosure, I've got ADHD, dyslexia and dyscalculia. I was
[23:13.320 --> 23:18.680]  diagnosed at 40 after 20 years working in the music industry. Many of those years, I heavily
[23:18.680 --> 23:23.480]  self medicated. So I was using and drinking drugs for a period of time. Like we often see many artists
[23:23.480 --> 23:28.120]  and people in the papers coming out and saying, I've been having these experiences because it's
[23:28.120 --> 23:32.280]  been a coping mechanism. And in the absence of knowing what they've got, I didn't know I had ADHD
[23:32.280 --> 23:36.040]  until I was 40, you use what's to hand. And if you're an environment where these things are kind
[23:36.040 --> 23:40.680]  of acceptable, more acceptable than in a wider society, that's often what people will do. But
[23:40.680 --> 23:45.800]  getting a later stage diagnosis has its own set of challenges and benefits to your question about
[23:45.800 --> 23:50.840]  coaching. When we understand that somebody has the condition, it's highly treatable. So the
[23:50.840 --> 23:55.560]  benefit of ADHD is it's really the most treatable of the mental health conditions,
[23:55.560 --> 24:00.440]  psychiatric conditions that's out there. The medication for ADHD has the highest efficacy
[24:00.440 --> 24:04.200]  of any mental health medication in the world. I'll just repeat that it has the highest efficacy
[24:04.360 --> 24:08.280]  of any mental health medication in the world. So it's highly treatable condition. The joy is
[24:08.280 --> 24:12.440]  that when we know that somebody's got ADHD, we can treat it, we can support it. I'm not a doctor,
[24:12.440 --> 24:17.240]  I'm not a clinician, I'm not advocating any particular medical or pharmacological approach
[24:17.240 --> 24:20.920]  here. But that's when that's combined with something like coaching, coaching is highly
[24:20.920 --> 24:24.920]  effective, because we know that given the right environment, we talk a lot about the idea of
[24:24.920 --> 24:29.400]  environment design, if you create a calm piece of environment for somebody to work in, where
[24:29.480 --> 24:35.320]  they have stability, structure, routine, that's very anchoring for them. And that then enables them
[24:35.320 --> 24:40.520]  to turn up on time. It enables them to do all of the other things that maybe other people that
[24:40.520 --> 24:44.600]  don't have ADHD find easier. And then obviously they can show up and they can perform as they might
[24:44.600 --> 24:48.920]  like to in their given task, whether that's being an artist or it's working at a live event and it's
[24:48.920 --> 24:54.040]  working in production in our record label, wherever it might be. So your question, Katie,
[24:54.040 --> 24:58.760]  coaching can be highly effective. Just in terms of what you do with someone when you're coaching,
[24:58.760 --> 25:04.520]  I'm thinking particularly about a musician who perhaps is a skilled violinist or pianist, but
[25:04.520 --> 25:09.320]  what they struggle with is regularly saying to themselves, I have to practice, I've got to
[25:09.320 --> 25:13.640]  pick up my instrument, I need to have a routine, I need to keep working at this. What are some of
[25:13.640 --> 25:18.680]  the practical things that you do to help them manage that? So it's the regularity of the routine,
[25:18.680 --> 25:23.400]  it's about making it obvious and easy for them. So say, for example, to take your violinist,
[25:23.400 --> 25:27.480]  you don't want the violin in a cupboard somewhere where you can't see it, you would like the violin
[25:27.480 --> 25:32.920]  to be out on a table where it's accessible, where they're going to see that instrument on a regular
[25:32.920 --> 25:37.960]  basis, where they've got the space to obviously pick up the bow and play as and when they would
[25:37.960 --> 25:42.200]  like to, free of distraction, where there's no one else around and there's no competing visual
[25:42.200 --> 25:46.680]  distractions, we've taken about sort of 40, 45% of information through the eyes. So we would like
[25:46.680 --> 25:52.120]  an environment where there's a calm space where they're not being visually pulled away or from
[25:52.120 --> 25:56.440]  an auditory point of view being distracted by other people. And it's the cadence of the practice
[25:56.440 --> 26:01.800]  that's important. So that if this person is able to show up on a day-to-day basis and play and perhaps
[26:01.800 --> 26:05.320]  record and hit themselves back so they can monitor their performance, that's going to be effective
[26:05.320 --> 26:10.520]  for them. Where people often struggle, sort of Casey's your point earlier about turning up on time,
[26:10.520 --> 26:15.160]  it's showing up for the thing that you want to do. And in the case that Sam's sharing here,
[26:15.160 --> 26:20.680]  it's about practicing. That's often the tricky bit. Again, with coaching, we can provide a structure
[26:20.680 --> 26:25.000]  that somebody chooses. If it's forced upon the person and it feels confining or constraining,
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.160]  they will push back against it and it will not work. This has to be a choice. But when they see
[26:29.160 --> 26:34.200]  what works for them and they start to take on these tools, tips and techniques and incorporate them
[26:34.200 --> 26:37.880]  into their everyday life, then they can start to turn up for their violin practice on a day-to-day
[26:37.880 --> 26:42.120]  basis and they can improve their practice. Different styles, different kinds of music and
[26:42.120 --> 26:47.880]  different parts of the music industry, I imagine, are easier, I would think, for people with ADHD.
[26:47.880 --> 26:54.040]  I mean, something like, you know, in a recording studio putting together a pop track, for instance,
[26:54.040 --> 26:57.800]  is going to be more self-expressive. You can stand around, you can get up,
[26:57.800 --> 27:02.120]  grab a coffee and all that kind of thing. Whereas sitting in an orchestra is a completely different
[27:02.120 --> 27:06.760]  kind of a skill, isn't it? Because it's sitting there often for long rehearsals, waiting for the
[27:06.760 --> 27:11.240]  conductor to tell you what to do and waiting whilst the other section of the orchestra plays.
[27:11.240 --> 27:16.200]  And I do wonder if it's harder for classical musicians in lots of ways.
[27:16.200 --> 27:21.880]  That's a great question. I imagine if you've got the hyperactive subtype of ADHD, so there's
[27:21.880 --> 27:27.320]  three types of ADHD, hyperactive, inattentive and combined type. If you've got the hyperactive
[27:27.320 --> 27:30.760]  subtype, absolutely, I can imagine that being very challenging. You're sitting there for long
[27:30.760 --> 27:35.240]  periods of time, not able to actively engage in playing or talking to people, and maybe you can
[27:35.240 --> 27:40.280]  chat to those people around you, but that you will be having to regulate emotionally, physically,
[27:40.280 --> 27:44.440]  which is going to be a much harder space to do that same regulation compared to the studio
[27:44.440 --> 27:48.280]  example you gave where you're jumping around, you're talking to people, all of those sorts of
[27:48.360 --> 27:53.240]  things. So yeah, I imagine for people playing within an orchestra, that that is potentially
[27:53.240 --> 27:56.840]  one of the greatest challenges they face. And what about music itself? I mean, both with the
[27:56.840 --> 28:00.200]  people you've worked with and your own experience in the music industry, we've talked about our
[28:00.200 --> 28:06.040]  reaction to music. Do you find music is something that helps you work? Do you find, for example,
[28:06.040 --> 28:10.040]  if you've got admin tasks to do, I, for example, cannot listen to music at all if I've got to
[28:10.040 --> 28:13.960]  focus on something, because Katie very much is different to that. Do you find that music is
[28:13.960 --> 28:18.280]  something that helps you work? Do you find it a distraction? How does music play a part in
[28:18.280 --> 28:22.200]  actually encouraging you to work, if that makes sense? It depends very much on the music, and it
[28:22.200 --> 28:28.040]  depends very much on the person. So I like you, Sam, don't listen to music when I'm working. I
[28:28.040 --> 28:32.680]  like total silence. I like to listen to music when I'm choosing to listen to music and enjoy it.
[28:32.680 --> 28:38.360]  And but if I'm working, I like total silence. Now, some people think like things like brown noise,
[28:38.360 --> 28:44.200]  or binaural beats. Brown noise can help tamp down the distracting parts of the ADHD brain,
[28:44.200 --> 28:48.520]  where they can focus more easily on the work that they're doing. Binaural beats can do a similar
[28:48.520 --> 28:52.600]  sort of thing. You're playing sort of two different, slightly two different frequencies in either ear.
[28:52.600 --> 28:58.680]  Music like sort of classical classical music that has a sort of even tempo cadence to it,
[28:58.680 --> 29:04.360]  sort of a medium, medium tempo, things like Vivaldi. Actually, that for a lot of people
[29:04.360 --> 29:10.760]  can be really helpful, where the strings where there's nothing to contrasting or shifting around
[29:10.760 --> 29:15.160]  the tempo and genre. A lot of people find that that sort of music and very helpful. Conversely,
[29:15.160 --> 29:21.000]  I know people that will listen to the most esoteric sorts of classical or thrashed metal
[29:21.000 --> 29:24.440]  or dance music or whatever it might be, the sort of things that maybe a lot of other people would
[29:24.440 --> 29:29.240]  find very distracting indeed. But for them, that works because it's creating sufficient arousal
[29:29.240 --> 29:34.440]  in their ADHD brain. ADHD brains are chronically under aroused. They're chronically deprived of
[29:34.440 --> 29:39.240]  the neurotransmitter, neuromodulator dopamine, which means that they can't focus on a regular
[29:39.240 --> 29:44.760]  basis and have the same emotional regulation that other people might have. But that with the
[29:44.760 --> 29:48.840]  greatest stimulation of some music, that hyper, that increased arousal in the brain,
[29:48.840 --> 29:52.840]  actually enables them to focus and concentrate better. So it really depends on the individual.
[29:52.840 --> 29:56.760]  There's a wide range of different musics out there, of course, to suit everyone. It's about
[29:56.760 --> 30:00.920]  finding what works for you or not. As we said before, for some people, it's just silence.
[30:00.920 --> 30:03.080]  Our old friend dopamine again. It's what gives you the buzz.
[30:03.080 --> 30:07.800]  Always. Can I ask one more question? And it's a subject that Sam and I talk about a lot.
[30:08.600 --> 30:12.920]  Ultimately, do you see ADHD as a good thing or a bad thing?
[30:12.920 --> 30:17.480]  For me personally, I wouldn't be who I am today without it. When I talk to people in the industry,
[30:17.480 --> 30:22.600]  artists, performers, music executives, almost across the board, they all say the same thing.
[30:22.600 --> 30:26.360]  It can be an incredibly challenging condition to manage. But with the right supports,
[30:26.440 --> 30:30.200]  you can thrive. And that's the key thing. It's about getting the right support. And that creative
[30:30.200 --> 30:33.960]  mind can be harnessed and you can absolutely excel at what you're doing.
[30:33.960 --> 30:38.520]  I completely agree, Tristan. I completely agree. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[30:38.520 --> 30:39.880]  It's been a pleasure to talk to you.
[30:39.880 --> 30:42.280]  Very welcome. Thanks very much, Katie. Thank you, Sam.
[30:52.280 --> 30:55.720]  I found that really interesting. Like so many of our guests, I suppose, he made me
[30:55.720 --> 30:59.480]  think, particularly when he was talking about practicing a musical instrument, when he was
[30:59.480 --> 31:05.640]  talking about putting in routine and having to do the hard work and overcoming that desire
[31:05.640 --> 31:09.960]  just to say, I don't want to do it. And actually, I think that's something that all of us with ADHD
[31:09.960 --> 31:13.960]  can think about, whether we're doing it in there, an area of learning a musical instrument,
[31:13.960 --> 31:17.080]  whether we're doing the workplace, whether it's something we do at home. And maybe,
[31:17.080 --> 31:20.600]  maybe I can use some of that and finally learn the piano.
[31:20.600 --> 31:25.000]  I think that's a really good idea. And I think it will be a journey that you will probably
[31:25.000 --> 31:27.240]  enjoy for the rest of your life. Or for the next three weeks.
